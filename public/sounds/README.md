# Score Announcement Audio Files

This folder contains placeholder MP3 files for score announcements. **You need to replace these empty files with actual audio recordings.**

Current files (all are empty placeholders):
- ten.mp3 - Announcement for score 10 ("Ten")
- nine.mp3 - Announcement for score 9 ("9")
- eight.mp3 - Announcement for score 8 ("8")
- seven.mp3 - Announcement for score 7 ("7")
- six.mp3 - Announcement for score 6 ("6")
- five.mp3 - Announcement for score 5 ("5")
- four.mp3 - Announcement for score 4 ("4")
- three.mp3 - Announcement for score 3 ("3")
- two.mp3 - Announcement for score 2 ("2")
- one.mp3 - Announcement for score 1 ("1")
- miss.mp3 - Announcement for score 0 ("Miss")

## How to create these files:

1. Use a text-to-speech service or recording software
2. Record a clear voice saying each number/word
3. Export as MP3 format
4. Keep files small (under 100KB each) for web performance
5. Ensure consistent volume and quality across all files

## Alternative: Use online TTS services

You can use free online text-to-speech services to generate these audio files:
- Google Translate TTS
- NaturalReaders
- TTSMP3.com
- Or any other TTS service that exports MP3

Just input the text (e.g., "Ten", "Nine", etc.) and download the MP3 files.

## Replace the placeholder files

Once you have the actual audio files, replace the empty files in this folder with your recordings. The app will automatically use them for score announcements.

## Note on file naming

The filenames correspond to how the scores are represented in the code:
- Score 10 → "Ten" → ten.mp3
- Score 9 → "9" → nine.mp3
- Score 8 → "8" → eight.mp3
- etc.
- Score 0 → "Miss" → miss.mp3
